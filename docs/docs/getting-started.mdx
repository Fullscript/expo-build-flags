# Getting started

## Install

import Tabs from "@theme/Tabs";
import TabItem from "@theme/TabItem";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="yarn" value="yarn">

```sh
yarn add -D expo-build-flags
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="npm" value="npm">

```sh
npm install -save-dev expo-build-flags
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Setup flags files

```sh
yarn build-flags init
```

Running this in your repo will:

- write a `flags.yml` file at the root of your repo
- write a `buildFlags.ts` in your src or app folder
- update your .gitignore to ignore the runtime file (`buildFlags.ts`)

## Workflow

To generate the gitignored runtime file using the existing flag states in flags.yml, run the override command of the CLI with no arguments:

```sh
yarn build-flags override
```

To enable a flag that's defaulted to off (false) in the base flags.yml file, run:

```sh
yarn build-flags override +flagNameToEnable
```

Likewise if there's a flag that's defaulted to on (true) in flags.yml and you want it off, run:

```sh
yarn build-flags override -flagNameToDisable
```

We recommend running the first command (`yarn build-flags override`) in your package.json `postinstall` script so that default flag states are used by default.
